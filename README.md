My name is __Ryo Nakagawara__. Born in __Japan__, grew up in __America__ & __Israel__, having also lived in __Germany__ & the __UK__, I am currently residing in __Tokyo, Japan__. I'm quite proud to say that I am a citizen of the world!

Currently working for [ACDI/VOCA](https://www.acdivoca.org/), an international development NGO, as a __Data Scientist__. For the past 4 years I have been doing work as both a reporting analyst & a software developer in __R__ & __SQL__. My main job has been improving ACDI/VOCA's __data pipeline__ & create R packages, reproducible reports, dashboards, & Shiny apps to communicate how our projects worldwide are progressing. I also manage our entire R code base that includes various __ETL scripts__, __R packages__, & software applications for __data collection/management__. 

I am also very involved in the R community (in Japan through [Tokyo.R](https://tokyor.connpass.com/) & internationally) through my volunteer work as an editor on the [RWeekly]() newsletter (from April 2019). In 2020, I also did some work as a soccer analytics consultant for [11tegen11](https://11tegen11.com/).
